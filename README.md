A simple todo app that uses a cassandra cluster with a single node in a local setting.
Make sure to be running a local cluster of cassandra on your system
I followed this tutorial for the installation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGhkX5z_vW8&list=PLalrWAGybpB-L1PGA-NfFu2uiWHEsdscD&index=4&ab_channel=jumpstartCS
(It's also a pretty good series on cassandra)
Note: During cassandra installation, I had to manually add the deb "http" blah blah link in the sources.list of my linux system, and then run sudo apt-get update
