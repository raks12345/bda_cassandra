A simple todo app that uses a cassandra cluster with a single node in a local setting.
Make sure to be running a local cluster of cassandra on your system.

I followed this tutorial for the installation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGhkX5z_vW8&list=PLalrWAGybpB-L1PGA-NfFu2uiWHEsdscD&index=4&ab_channel=jumpstartCS

(It's also a pretty good series on cassandra)

Note: During cassandra installation, I had to manually add the deb "http" blah blah link in the sources.list of my linux system, and then run sudo apt-get update

Run app.py in root directory of project
